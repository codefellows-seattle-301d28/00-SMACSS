##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I followed the concepts placed in the git repo.

Base.css contained the main proponents of the page: body, main, footer.
Layout.css contained the general layout of content on the page.
Modules.css contained more of the styling of elements.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not... was I supposed to? I moved the stylings to the stylesheets that represented the content best and refreshed to make sure the page itself remained unchanged.
