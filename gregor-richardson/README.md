##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Using the outline from the SMACSS manual I placed default rules into base, section specific code into layout, and element-specific tags into modules.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I didn't find anything that was begging to be refactored, but I'd be interested in learning what things to look out for in the future.
