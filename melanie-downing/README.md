##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I determined weather the style referred to the entire document, or if it was specific to an element. Base.css contains more global selectors, layout pertains to specific sections, and modules contains specific list items and finer detailed syling.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I changed the file path for the recipe image since it was not able to accurately locate the file in a separate folder. With more time, I would have reorganized the order in which each query selector was typed. I would also change IDs to classes in order to improve reusability.
