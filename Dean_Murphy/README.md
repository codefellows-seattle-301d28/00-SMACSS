##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

By how much these specific items would carry over between pages if this were a multiple page app, items that appeared on all of them regardless and unchanging were base, other items that are still very permanent but subject to change are in the layout, and the module was for things specific to that exact page.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

Nope
