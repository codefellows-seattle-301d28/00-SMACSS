##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

things that was layout based went in the layout.css, things that did overall look and global went into the base.css, and things that are inside a scope went into the modules.css

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

i had to put the reset.css first to fix my issues.
