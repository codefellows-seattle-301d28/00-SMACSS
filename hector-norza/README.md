##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?
base.css contains general styling on top of what is provided by a reset.css or normalize.css file (these files will be discussed in further detail in lecture)

layout.css contains general positioning on the page
it applies to elements such as header, footer, nav, aside

modules.css contains smaller components on the page
it applies to elements such as list items, individual images, specific paragraphs

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not. But I wanted to make sure I submitted it in time. I will check later to see what I can do.
